## Hi there 👋
I’m Frederico Fortes, a tech student based in Cabo Verde.

I’m still in the learning phase, exploring different areas of tech and slowly building the foundations I need to create the ideas that come to mind. Step by step, I’m figuring out my path — but I’m leaning toward Data Science.

#### Tech Stack
Right now, I’m working with: Linux, MySQL, C, HTML and CSS.  

What I’m planning to learn next: Java, PHP and Python.  

My favorite tool: VS Code  

#### Projects
I haven’t built any public projects yet, but I’m planning to start soon.  
No idea how many I’ll create — hopefully a lot!

#### Fun Facts  
I enjoy Muay Thai  

I love gaming  

I listen to music basically all the time
